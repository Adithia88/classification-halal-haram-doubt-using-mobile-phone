Dataset (Train) : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZChEqrCwlTKolwT69ExNPnA_CtBkmNo?usp=sharing

The repository includes:
* Using teachable machine learning for image classification 
* Evaluation (confussion matrix) 
* Deploy it to Mobile phone 


# Getting Started
Download this repo and dataset too, if u want use this dataset
* start from making image classification models using teachable machine learning 
* deploy on mobile phone

additional info :
teachable machine is algorithm to make model easy based on web ( https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image )


# Training on Your Own Dataset using teachable machine learning

1. Make sure the path like this, and open this link : https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image

![Important Path](assets/2.PNG)

![u can see the UI from teachable Machine ](assets/3.PNG)

2. Upload all data to teachable machine, just drag it and drop to upload link

4. Download 2 model , we need 2 model to deploy it to android

* click export model and go to tensorflow lite mode and download "floating point" and "quantized model"

# Deploy on android

1. after u download this repo, go to path : "Halal_haram_doubt detector\app\src\main\assets" and put it the download model and extract it

2. download android studio and install it, u can download here : https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=id

3. open android studio and exisiting project 

![android studio ](assets/9.PNG)

it will take time for download some gradle 

4.just put the path where u place this repo 

![android studio ](assets/10.PNG)

5. go to build - build APK
